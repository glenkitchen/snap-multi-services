### 4. Image Sourcing

Source images from open-source image websites. When you include an image, provide a comment with the source URL directly above the img tag.

- **Header**: Include the company logo and navigation menu
- **Hero section**: Highlight the company's main services with a striking image

- **Features and Benefits**: Clearly communicate key features and benefits to customers
- **Call-to-Action**: Encourage visitors to contact or request a quote
- **Footer**: Include contact information and any necessary links

### 6. Styling Guidelines

Use appropriate TailwindCSS classes for styling text, buttons, and layout. Ensure the design is visually appealing and aligns with the company's professional image.

### 7. Code Documentation

Include comments in your HTML to explain the purpose of different sections and any complex structures.

### 8. File Output

After completing the HTML file, save it as `UI.html`.

## Important Notes

Remember to focus on clearly communicating the company's services, equipment categories, and benefits to potential customers throughout the landing page.

Provide your complete HTML code inside `<html_code>` tags. Do not include any explanations or comments outside of the HTML file itself.
